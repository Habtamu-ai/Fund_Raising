# Kickstarter_Challange
# Overview
The main objective of this project is by analyzing the kickstarter data we plan to help Louis to launch her first ever successful fundraising. For this we have investigated a historical fund-raising data from different countries. This data contained 9 years data from 21 different countries. The fund raising have been conducted almost in all months of the year in the respective countries and there local currency. 

We have undertaken our analysis based on two main variables the “Launch date” of the project and  “Goal” that was set to raise in USD. Underneath we will see the outcomes of the fundraisings based on the selected variables.
 
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By using the kickstart data we are planning to do analysis based on the launch date. For that we had to create a year column by using 'Year()' function using ” Lunch _at” column. From the big Kickstarter data we created a small table to see if the Launch date has really affected the fundraising outcomes. We filtered and created this table to closely see the effect of the launch date on the outcomes of the fundraising. As we can clearly see from the tables December and January are the most successful months and February and March stands top on the failed column. From this we might suggest, it is good to Launch our fundraising in December and January. One possible reason for this might be people are in a holiday mood and would like to spend more, go out and watch Ttheater. buy stuffs and give gifs. However, most failed fundraisings happened to be in February and March  which could possibly be explained by the trauma of too much expense on the previous two months and the winter weather. During this time most people would like to stay at home and try to avoid going out for fun until the summer comes.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our second analysis focuses on the 'goal'  that was set to achieve by USD on the fundraisings. For this we are going to present the chart that was created from the kickstart data set based on the amount of dollars that was set to raise. As we can see in our chart "outcomes based on goals" projects that had a goal of above $45000 has failed miserably. On the other side, projects that was set to raise between $ 25000 and $30000 was very successful. In addition, 55% of the them was successful among those who planed to raise l between 5000 and 10000.

### CONCLUSION
from the result of Launch date analysis we might conclude that, Its good to launch our fund raising on December and January.It would also be advisable to consider the high failure rate in February and March. In addition, from the second analysis we might advise Louis to raise the fundraising role to USD 25000. Because as we can clearly see from the chart Projects that had goal above USD 45000  and less than 10000was was unsuccessful. So it is good for louis to think the amount of dollar that are not too big or to less may attract potential producers.
#### Limitation
I would assume the data has limitation on considering the economic situation of the countries. Since the fund raising was undertaken in different countries and in different currencies, by just looking the amount of dollars that was collected we might be baiased to do our analysis and give recommendations.
On thee other hand, we could have done more regorous analysis by cosidering specific country and specific curreny specially similar with Louis. 

My overall assessment and recommendation for the project planned by louis is, it would be good if the project would be launched  on December or January and it would also be good to raise her fundraising goal a little bit higher and try to attract bigger producers.
