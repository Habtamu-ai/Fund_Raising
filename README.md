# Kickstarter_Challange
# Overview
The main objective of this project is by analyzing the kickarter data we plan to help Louis, launch her first ever successful fundraising.For this we have investigated a historical fund-raising data from different countries. This data contained 9 years data from 21 different countries. The fund raising have been conducted almost in all months of the year in their respective countries and there local currency. We have undertaken our analysis based on two main variables the “Launch date” of the project and  “Goal” that was set to raise in USD. Underneath we will see the outcomes of the fundraisings based on the selected variables.
By analyzing the kickarter data we plan to help Louis launch her first ever successful fundraising.
 
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By using the kickstart data we are planning to do analysis based on the launch date. For that we had to create a year column by using Year() function on using ” Lunch _at” column. From the big Kickstarter data we created a small table to see if Launch date has really affected the fundraising outcomes.We filtered and created this table to closely see the effect of the launch date on the outcomes of the fundraising. As we can clearly see from the tables December and January are the most successful months and February and March stands top on the failed column. From this we might suggest, it is good to Launch our fundraising in December and January. One possible reason for this might be people are in a holiday mood and would like to spend more, go out and watch Ttheater and buy and give gifs. However, most failed fundraisings happened to be in February and March could possibly explained by the trauma of too much expense on the previous two months and the winter weather during this time might affect people from going out.
### CONCLUSION
The two main conclusion drown from this table analysis are
1.	 Its good to launch our fund raising on theatre on December and January.
2.	 It would also be advisable to consider high failure rate in February and March.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our second analysis focuses on the goal that was set to achieve by USD on the fundraisings. For this we are going to present the chart that was created from the kickstart data set based on the amount of dollars that was set to raise. As we can see in our chart "outcomes based on goals" projects that had a goal of above $45000 fad failed miserably. On the other side, projects that was set to raise between $ 25000 and $30000 was very successful. In addition, 55% of the them was successful among those who planed to raise l between 5000 and 10000. 
### Conclusion
Projects that had goal above $45000 was unsuccessful. So it is good for louis to think the amount of dollar that are not too big or to less. 
I would assume the data has a limitation on missing the economic situation of the countries. And there currencies purchasing power.
On the analysis part we could have created other tables and statistical analysis like if there are outliers, descriptive statistics table, we could also have seen different outcomes by country.
My overall assessment and recommendation for the project planned by louis is, its good to launch it on December or January and it is also good to raise her goal a little bit higher and attract bigger producers.
