# Kickstarter_Challange
# Overview
The main objective of this project is to  analyze the kickstarter data and understand the  different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. For this,  we use historical data of fund rising covering  9 years from 21 different countries.  Below, we analyse the data and recommend Louis the most successful fundraising based on  'launch' date and 'goal'.

 
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using launch date,  we aim  to identify the most successful month in fund raising. To do so, we first create a year variable  ('Year()' function) using  ” Lunch _at” column. Second, we use pivot to create a small table and examine if the Launch date has affected the fundraising outcomes. Third, we filtered and created the table below to closely see the effect of the launch date on the outcomes of the fundraising. We find that December and January are the most successful months while February and March are the least successful.One possible explanation for the high fundrising on Decemeber and January would be these months are holidays seasons and people tend to spend much.In contrast, in February and March people may not spent much and may not contribute for fundraising as they have already spent in the previous months. In addition, during these months most people may stay at home until summer comes. As such,Louis should launch her fundraising in December and January.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Here we look at most successful fundraisings based on goal. To do so, first, we created a pivot table for goals and amount of fundraising. Second, we produce the chart below. We find that projects aiming at fundraising between $25,000 and $30,000 is the most successful.Wheras, fundraising with a goal of above $45,000 is the least successful. As such, we suggest Louis to consider the fundraising goail between $25,000 and $30,000.

### CONCLUSION
We analyse the kickstart data to identify the most successful fundraising based on 'launch' date and 'goal'. We find that fundraising in December and January is the most successful period while February and March are the least succesful months. Looking at the fundraising based on goal, $25000-$30,000 is found to be the most successful. Therefore, Louis may consider December and January as a fundrasing period. She might also set her goal $25000-$30,000.

#### Limitation
Among the limitations, the fundrasing does not consider the economic difference between countries. The most successulg months and goal might depend on the country she aim to raise the fund. The analysis could be better and more rigorous if we look at fundraising months and goals by country.
